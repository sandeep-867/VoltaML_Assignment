# VoltaML_Assignment
This repository is created for the purpose of submission of VoltaML assignment.
The dataset for this project has been obtained by generating the signals from MATLAB and then plotting those signals in a scatter plot. These images are then trained for various models built using resnet 50 architecture and the final model is obtained by cascading all the five models. The final model is tested upon the testing data and an accuracy of about 80 percent is achieved.
