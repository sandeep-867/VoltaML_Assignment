# VoltaML_Assignment
This repository is created for the purpose of submission of VoltaML assignment.
The dataset for this project has been obtained by generating the signals from MATLAB and then plotting those signals in a scatter plot.
 These images are then trained for various models built using resnet 50 architecture and the final model is obtained by cascading all the five models. The final model is tested upon the testing data and an accuracy of about 80 percent is achieved. 
The dataset folder has the training testing and validating data folders. 
This dataset folder is placed in same directory as that of the training files and then to be run. 
All the models are stored in the Models folder and then finally loaded when required while testing the model. 
Thus, a Models folder is to be created and then the files are to be run in order wise to save them and then the testing folder is to be run.
